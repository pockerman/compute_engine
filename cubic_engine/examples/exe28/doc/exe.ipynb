    "MPC originated in the late seventies. The term MPC does not designate a specific control strategy but rather a range of control methods which make explicit use of a model of the process to obtain the control signal by minimizing an objective function. These design methods lead to controllers which have practically the same structure and present adequate degrees of freedom. The ideas, appearing in greater or lesser degree in the predictive control family, are basically:"

    "In very simple terms, a MP controller uses a model of the system in order to make predictions about the systemâ€™s future behavior. The way this is done is by solving optimization problem in order to find the optimal control action that drives the predicted output to the reference. In general, the MPC framework  handle multi-input multi-output systems that may have interactions between their inputs and outputs. Furthermore, the framework  can also handle input and output constraints."
